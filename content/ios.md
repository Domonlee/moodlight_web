Moe Memos is first developed for iPhone and iPad. It was submitted for App Store review on Sep 12, 2022. While most apps should be reviewed in 48 hours and I strongly believe Moe Memos fully complies with the App Store Review Guidelines, for unknown reasons, Apple rejected the submission with the following message.

> Thank you for submitting your app for review.
> 
> We need additional time to evaluate your submission and Apple Developer Program account. Your submission status will appear as "Rejected" in App Store Connect while we investigate. However, we do not require a revised binary or additional information from you at this time.
> 
> If we notice any issues that require your attention, we will let you know via App Store Connect. If we find no issues with your submission or account, the submission will be approved.
> 
> If you have not heard back from us after 7 business days from the date you received this message and would like to inquire about the status of our review, you may file a request via the Apple Developer Contact Us page.

I tried contacting Apple and provided more information about the app and myself in the past few weeks. However Apple only replied the following template email several times with no indication when or how the review could be processed.

> Thank you for contacting App Store Review regarding your app, â€œMoe Memos."
>
> I understand your concern regarding the extended review time of your app. However, we still need additional time for review due to high submission volume.
>
> I escalated your request to the appropriate internal team, but we can't provide an estimated completion time. When the review is completed, we'll notify you about any next steps in the App Review section in App Store Connect.
>
> We appreciate your continued patience.

In the mean time, Moe Memos is available for [beta testing on TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/YVHheZ50).

Moe Memos is built with full respect of users' privacy in mind. Moe Memos does not collect any data and makes zero network connection to the developer.

Moe Memos requires a self-hosted [✍️memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) server to sync your data. Moe Memos only stores your session key or Open API in your devices' secure storage and your login credentials are not stored.

The developer of Moe Memos strongly recommends you only host the server on your own local hardware to fully protect your data. If you prefer to host your Memos server on the internet (a.k.a. someone else's computer), you are subject to the privacy policy of your host provider. Please make sure to connect to your Memos server only via HTTPS or local network.

Moe Memos is not affiliated with the open source project [✍️memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos).

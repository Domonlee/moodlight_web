Moe Memos is built with full respect of users' privacy in mind. Moe Memos does not collect any data and makes zero network connection to the developer.

The current version of Moe Memos relies on a self-hosted [✍️memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) server to work. Moe Memos only stores your session key in your devices' secure keychain and your login credentials are not stored.

The developer of Moe Memos strongly recommends you only host the server on your own local hardware to fully protect your data. If you prefer to host your Memos server on the internet (a.k.a. someone else's computer), you are subject to the privacy policy of your host provider. Moe Memos uses the default App Transport Security feature on iOS and you are required to connect to your Memos server via HTTPS or local network.

Moe Memos is not affiliated with the open source project [✍️memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos).
